//Description: This program will collect grades for one assignment

#include<iostream>
#include<fstream>

using namespace std;

//Q1: create a constant integer named CLASS_SIZE
const int;

int main(){
    //Q2: ask the user to enter a class title

    //Q3: open an output filestream using the class title

    //Q4: create an array with size CLASS_SIZE to hold the grades

    //Q5: create variable to store a minimum grade, a maximum grade, and the
    //  sum of all of the grades. Initialize all of the variables.

    //Q6: create a for loop
    //  Q6a: initialize a variable i=0;
    //  Q6b: run while i is less than CLASS_SIZE
    //  Q6c: increase i by 1 every time the loop runs
    for(){
        //Q7a: prompt the user to enter a grade using a do...while loop

        //Q7b: store the new grade in the file

    }

    //Q8: create a while loop
    //  Q8a: initialize a variable i=0;
    //  Q8b: run while i is less than CLASS_SIZE
    //  Q8c: increase i by 1 every time the loop runs

    while(){
        //Q9a: if grades[i] is the smallest processed yet, update the minimum variable

        //Q9b; if grades[i] is the largest processed yet, update the maximum variable

        //Q9c: add grades[i] into the sum variable

    }

    //Q10a: print the maximum grade
    cout << "The maximum grade is: ";
    //Q10b: print the minimum grade
    cout << "The minimum grade is: ";
    //Q10c: print the average grade
    cout << "The average grade is: ";

    //Q11: close your output file and print a goodbye message

    return 0;
